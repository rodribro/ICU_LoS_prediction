### <b> Large Scale Data Science project </b>

* <b> Goal: </b> The goal of this project is to establish a Machine Learning pipeline that is able to efficently consume and process large amounts of data as well as to accurately predict the length of stay in ICU for a given patient based on the [MIMIC-III dataset](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/). To that end, we'll be using multiprocressing and parallel processing techniques to ease memory usage and time consumption.

* <b> Tech stack: </b> Python (Scikit-learn, Dask, PsycoPG2), PostGreSQL, Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery)

* <b> How to locally set-up the project: </b> TBA

NB: the file [Chart Events](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/tables/chartevents/) will not be included in the github repo due to its ~36GB size.
